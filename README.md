## PyMTMessages
`PyMTMessages` is an attempt to write a parser for [SWIFT Messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT_message_types)
Started with _MT 101_ message and will write for other format as well. The returned format is in JSON.

It is pretty raw at the moment. Later planning to write a class around all messages.

All samples are being used from [here](https://www.paymentcomponents.com/demo/mt/). You are free to cover other cases and ask for a PR.
